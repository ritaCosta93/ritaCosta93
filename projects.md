Non-verbal people often have problems formulating ideas and expressing themselves without the help of gestures or images, that’s where this app comes in.

**Game of Life Simulation**                                                                                       
December 2023
https://github.com/ritaCosta93/gameoflife
This project is a simulation of Conway's Game of Life, a cellular automaton devised by mathematician John Conway. The simulation allows you to observe the evolution of a grid of cells based on simple rules.

**Email Sentiment Analysis with OpenAI's GPT-3**
November 2023
https://github.com/ritaCosta93/ai-email-sentiment-analyzer
Analyze sentiments of emails from your inbox using the power of OpenAI's GPT-3! A Python-based tool designed to process and extract sentiments seamlessly from emails, giving you insight into your communication.

**Linear Classification Simulation**                                                                            
November 2023
https://github.com/ritaCosta93/forest-simulation
The script generates a two-dimensional scatter plot with two categories of points, 'Unsafe' and 'Safe', which are to be separated by a decision boundary. Users can interactively adjust this boundary and run an optimization routine to improve the separation. This hands-on approach is designed to help users grasp the mechanics behind linear classifiers in AI.
